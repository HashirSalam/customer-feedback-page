<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Feel free to fill the form and the graph will show live stats according to the ratings.

Form:

    Filling the form posts the comments and renders the chart.

    The comments are stored in localstorage and can be visited later again.

Chart:

    5 , 4 stars -- > Excellent

    3 ,2 stars -- > Good

    1 star --> Poor

Deployment:
The app is deployed via vercel and can be viewd on (<a href="https://customer-feedback-page.vercel.app/">Demo</a>)

## Roadmap (whatâ€™s left to improve and why.)

    1) The first thing that I would add would be storybook components for better UI development, testing, and documentation.

    2) Some CSS animations and transitions to smoothen out some of the changes.
